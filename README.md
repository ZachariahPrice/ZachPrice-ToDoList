# ZachPrice-ToDoList

I was tasked with creating my own ToDo list for my MIT course. Once we were finished we were tasked with styling it to fit our preferences. The design I chose was simple but also still tried to achieve a style that looks good. I went with a nice green, green feels like the right colour for ToDo lists and I'm not quite sure why. Also added a text box and shadow box and then I was done. I had originally planned to go with something that felt much more modern, but was unable to go down that route.
